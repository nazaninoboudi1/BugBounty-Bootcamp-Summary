## üöÄ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a Bug Bounty Platform
- **Popular Platforms**: 
  - [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com)
  - [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com)
  - [Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com)
- **Scope**: Always check the program‚Äôs `scope.txt` or rules. Never test out-of-scope assets!

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Lab Environment
#### Install Tools
```bash
# Example: Install Sublist3r
git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git
cd Sublist3r
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure Burp Suite:
- Open Burp Suite and set up a temporary project.
- Configure your browser proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080.
- Install Burp‚Äôs CA certificate to intercept HTTPS traffic.

  ### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
Subdomain Enumeration
```
python3 sublist3r.py -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
```
Technology Stack Identification
- Use Wappalyzer (browser extension) to detect frameworks (e.g., WordPress, React).

Port Scanning with Nmap
```
nmap -sV -p 1-1000 -T4 example.com -oN scan.txt
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerability Hunting
Common Tests
- SQL Injection: Test URL parameters with ' OR 1=1--.

- XSS: Inject <script>alert(1)</script> into input fields.

- CORS Misconfigurations: Send headers like Origin: https://evil.com.

Automate with FFUF (Fuzzing)
```
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ
```
## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Write a Professional Report
A good report includes:

- Title: Clear and concise (e.g., "Reflected XSS in search parameter").

- Steps to Reproduce: Detailed, numbered instructions.

- Impact: Explain how the vulnerability could be exploited.

- Proof of Concept (PoC): Attach screenshots/videos.

- Remediation: Suggest a fix (e.g., input sanitization).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Guidelines
- Stay Within Scope: Only test authorized targets.

- Avoid Damage: Do not disrupt services or access sensitive data.

- Respect Privacy: Never exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain.

 ## üåü Pro Tips
- Start Small: Focus on low-hanging fruit (e.g., XSS, misconfigurations).

- Join Communities: Follow @Bugcrowd and r/bugbounty on Reddit.

- Practice Daily: Consistency is key to mastering bug hunting.
